<h1> Coding Challenge </h1>

<h2> Challenges </h2>
<ol>
<li>Writing DRY html/css - a lot of this layout was "mirrored" - the same pieces were repeated but with different positions. It was challening to know how to divy up the html, and i feel like i have some useless classes that were only used for styling purposes</li>
<li>Adding in the orange horizontal lines </li>
<li>Deciding how to position the centered 'featured-events' img - ended up positioning it absolute on-top of all other items (also used z-index here)</li>
</ol>

<h2> Outstanding Issues </h2>
<ol>
<li> Had to use a hacky way to calculate sizes - used my on-screen ruler to calculate the size of my #main-container and #sub-container and they every other size/padding/dimension was based off of that. Not ideal.</li>
<li> The horizontal lines are just empty divs with a border. Don't really like this as it seems like wasted HTML</li>
</ol>
